### arduino

<pre>an open source programmable circuit board and microcontroller<br>that makes it possible for anyone to build digital hardware products

- most popular model : UNO<br>
- microcontroller
  small inexpensive computer that can run on low power<br>  board is surrounded by pins that can be used to
  construct a circuit by connecting various input and output devices<br>
- USB port
  used to upload code to the device<br>
- software : sketch
  writren in purpose-built easy to learn programming language<br>  every program has 2 basic functions<br>
  1) setup()
     setup runs once, when the hardware is first powered on<br>
  2) loop()
     loop runs continuously to react to signals from input devices or
     changes to the state of program 

  used to build IoT products, robots, wearable devices, ...
